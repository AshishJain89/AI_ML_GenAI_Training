      "\n",
      "**1. Accelerate the global transition to 100% renewable energy sources:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pros:**  Most effective long-term solution for mitigating climate change by drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Renewable energy sources are sustainable and have minimal environmental impact compared to fossil fuels.\n",
      "* **Cons:**  High upfront investment costs, potential for job losses in fossil fuel industries, intermittency of some renewable sources requiring energy storage solutions.\n",
      "* **Feasibility:**  Technically feasible, with rapidly advancing renewable energy technologies. However, requires significant political will, international cooperation, and public support.\n",
      "* **Probability of Success:**  Moderate to high.  Growing public awareness and decreasing costs of renewable energy are driving its adoption. However, overcoming political and economic barriers remains a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Implement large-scale reforestation and afforestation projects:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pros:**  Cost-effective way to sequester carbon, restore degraded ecosystems, enhance biodiversity, and improve water quality.\n",
      "* **Cons:**  Land availability, potential for deforestation in other areas to make way for plantations, risk of monoculture plantations impacting biodiversity, and time required for trees to mature and effectively sequester carbon.\n",
      "* **Feasibility:**  Technically feasible, but requires careful planning and implementation to ensure sustainability and avoid unintended consequences.\n",
      "* **Probability of Success:**  Moderate.  Success depends on effective land management, community engagement, and addressing potential conflicts with other land uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Promote sustainable agricultural practices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pros:**  Reduces emissions from agriculture, enhances soil health and fertility, improves water use efficiency, and increases resilience to climate change impacts like droughts and floods.\n",
      "* **Cons:**  Requires changes in farming practices and potentially lower yields in the short term, may require additional investment in training and technology, and faces resistance from farmers accustomed to traditional methods.\n",
      "* **Feasibility:**  Technically feasible and increasingly adopted by farmers worldwide. However, widespread adoption requires policy support, access to information and resources, and addressing market barriers.\n",
      "* **Probability of Success:**  Moderate to high.  Growing awareness of the benefits of sustainable agriculture and increasing demand for sustainably produced food are driving its adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Develop and deploy advanced carbon capture and storage technologies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pros:**  Can directly remove CO2 from the atmosphere, potentially mitigating existing climate change impacts.\n",
      "* **Cons:**  Currently expensive and energy-intensive, requires large-scale infrastructure development, potential for leakage of captured CO2, and ethical concerns about geoengineering.\n",
      "* **Feasibility:**  Technically feasible, but requires significant research and development to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\n",
      "* **Probability of Success:**  Moderate.  Technological advancements are being made, but widespread deployment faces economic and political challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pros:**  Protects communities and critical infrastructure from the impacts of extreme weather events, reduces economic losses, and saves lives.\n",
      "* **Cons:**  High upfront costs, may not be effective against all types of extreme weather events, and can displace vulnerable communities if not implemented carefully.\n",
      "* **Feasibility:**  Technically feasible, but requires careful planning and investment prioritization.\n",
      "* **Probability of Success:**  High.  Investing in resilient infrastructure is essential for adapting to the impacts of climate change, and many countries are already doing so.\n",
